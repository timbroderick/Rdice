# New release 

In the new release we have:
* adjusted the output of the function `coin.flip` for the case `coins = 1` providing table of frequencies too.
* the output results of the function `nonTransitive.generator` are being output sorted rather than in the random order they are generated.
* introduced new functions and combinatorical problems with corresponding solutions (see documentation and vignette). In particular the function `birthday.problem`, solving the exercise of calculating the probability that two or more people happen to be born between a certain number of days from each other.
